# JohbGCC v1.3

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3Hr0nyt.png" width="45%">
 
This board is based on the PhobGCC v1.2.3 board (https://github.com/PhobGCC/PhobGCC-HW).  
  
It is 100% compatible with the PhobGCC software but requires a custom teensy.h. (More info below).  

--- 
  
The Board was made with KiCad version 6.0.5.  
Gerber and assembly production files were created using the KiCad plugin "JLCPCB Tools"  (https://github.com/Bouni/kicad-jlcpcb-tools).  


# Changes

- **Rotated the stickbox into original position**  
- **Rotated the Teensy 180Â°**  
- **Optimized the board paneling for manufacturing**  
- **Added some labels to make it very fail proof and easier to build**  
- **Tried to make the board easier to desolder (More info below)**  

## Other changes 

- **Both hall sensors on the c stick have a decoupling capacitor now**  
- **Routed the 3.3V and filled the top layer with GND too**

# Custom teensy.h
  
Before uploading the PhobGCC software to the Teensy you need to copy the teensy.h for this board ("Johb1_3Teensy4_0.h") into the "teensy" folder that comes with the Phob software and tell it to use it.   
  
The *teensy.h"* is the configuration file that tells the Phob software to what pins the buttons, triggers, hall sensors are connected to the Teensy.  
  
This board requires a custom one because I re-routed most of the board after rotating the Teensy and to keep tracks nice and short I switched the GPIO pins.  


## Adding the JohbGCC teensy.h 

**Step by step:**
1.  Download the PhobGCC software (https://github.com/PhobGCC/PhobGCC-SW/releases)
2.  Download the JohbGCC teensy.h (https://github.com/8n1/JohbGCC/blob/master/Johb1_3Teensy4_0.h) and put it into the "teensy" folder that is included in the PhobGCC software zip file.
3.  Edit the file "common/phobGCC.h" to use the added JohbGCC teensy.h by adding this line as shown in the picture below:  
```
#include "../teensy/Johb1_3Teensy4_0.h"             // For JohbGCC board 1.3.x with Teensy 4.0
```

4.  Done. Upload it to the Teensy. 

This has been tested with PhobGCC software v0.27 (https://github.com/PhobGCC/PhobGCC-SW/releases/tag/v0.27).  
For earlier versions the steps were slightly different.  
   
This is the only thing necessary to use the JohbGCC board with the PhobGCC software.  

# Modified/cut rumble bracket

It is necessary to modify the rumble bracket because the pins of the hall sensor interfere with it.  
  
**THIS MUST BE DONE, otherwise the controller can't be closed without force which causes various issues because the hall sensor pins will get crushed.**

The text I put there says that it would be also possible to make the hall sensor pins flat instead but I found it much easier to just cut out a small part of the rumble bracket like shown in the pictures below so I would always recommend doing that.

# Making it easier to desolder

I wanted to make the holes for some parts like the L/R potentiometer and GCC cable not through hole plated to make it easier to desolder (as it is on a OEM GCC board) but I haven't looked into how to do this enough and misunderstood a option in KiCad ("connected layers only") so I didn't got exactly what I wanted:  
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/QW1Yvjd.jpeg" width="35%">   
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/aZqT88x.jpeg" width="35%">   
   
But that's not bad actually, part success!  
They are still through hole plated, what that option did was to only remove the solder ring on the side where it's not needed.

... 

After doing some research it looks like that KiCad doesn't has this exact option built in.   
But what you can do is take a smd pad and put a not trough hole plated hole (aka. mounting hole) in the middle of it. But this way this manufacturer specification limitation comes into play (this is from jlcpcb):

(I want to try this out with the mounting pins of the potentiometers on the next board I make.)
